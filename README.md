# Pr. Badinov
Pr. Badinov is a simple number base conversion tool handling decimal, binary and hexadecimal.
Formerly a CLI hexadecimal ⇔ decimal converter for a school assignment, I turned it into a GUI software to try my hand at GUI programming.

(For what it’s worth: no pun intended in the application’s name, but feel free to think so.)

## Requirements
All you need is **[Python 3.x](http://www.python.org)**.
Then just go to the project directory and run `python3 badinov.py`.

## Licence
GPL v.3
